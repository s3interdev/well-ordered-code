# Well Ordered Code

## Description

Proper management of git is essential to organizing your code in a reasonable way. In this project I will attempt to organize code into staging and production ready master branches so that there is always a version of the code is ready to go. Then, I show that you can work on feature branches and get everything perfect before merging to staging using a pull request.
