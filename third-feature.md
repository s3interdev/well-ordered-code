# Third Feature

## Summary

Ye-ha! _She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod_. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.

**Hokey religions** and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. You mean it controls your actions? Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
